# Enable-Accounts
##Recursive Function
This script is ran in a way that you are able to re-enter a username if you feel that you have entered in the initial username wrong.

##Checks for confirmation
After entering in username it prompts user to check if the username is entered in correctly.
User answers with a yes / no and script reacts accordingly

##Wanted Improvements
Create functionality to enable more than one account at a time, whether it be entering all the accounts on a input line or being able to run the program continuously again until told otherwise
